[Console]{#glossary-console}

:  Coming soon.

[Data frame]{#glossary-data-frame} 

:  For our purposes, data frames are just R's term for data set or data table. Data frames are made up of columns (variables) and rows (observations). In R, all columns of a data frame must have the same length.

[Functions]{#glossary-functions} 

:  Coming soon.

  * **Arguments:** Arguments always go _inside_ the parentheses of a function and give the function the information it needs to give us the result we want.   

  * **Pass:** In programming lingo, you _pass_ a value to a function argument. For example, in the funtion call `seq(from = 2, to = 100, by = 2)` we could say that we passed a value of 2 to the `from` argument, we passed a value of 100 to the `to` argument, and we passed a value of 2 to the `by` argument.  

  * **Returns:** Instead of saying, “the `seq()` function _gives us_ a sequence of numbers…” we could say, “the `seq()` function _returns_ us a sequence of numbers…” In programming lingo, functions _return_ one or more results.
